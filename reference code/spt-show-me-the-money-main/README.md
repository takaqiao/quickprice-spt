As many of you have seen in the recent announcements from the SPT developers on Discord about the changes with Tarkov 1.0, the long-term outlook for SPT and FIKA is uncertain. If you haven’t read their message yet, you can find it here:

https://discord.com/channels/875684761291599922/875706629260197908/1439239841895158022

FIKA will no longer be adding major new features, focusing instead on support and bug fixes for as long as SPT remains viable.

For my mod, I’ll be taking a similar approach: I’ll continue providing maintenance updates and fixing bugs, but I don’t currently plan to develop new large-scale features. The project has grown far beyond what I expected when I started it, and it has genuinely been great to read your feedback and turn it into improvements. Thank you for every comment and conversation on Discord.

The mod’s source code is available on GitHub, so if anyone wants to fork it and build new features on top of it, feel free - you have my blessing.

## Tabs {.tabset}

### SMTM
#### What does it do?

Imagine examining an item in Tarkov and having the game whisper gently into your ear:  
“Here’s exactly how much money this thing is worth, who will buy it, and whether selling it is a brilliant idea or a catastrophic financial farce.”

That’s what SMTM does. It modifies the in-game tooltip to reveal:

- The trader who will pay you the *most* (because some traders appreciate your junk more than others)  
- The flea market price required to achieve a **100% chance of sale**  
- Both **price per slot** and **total price**, helpfully highlighted so you don’t have to do arithmetic  
- Optional inclusion of flea market taxes, for those who enjoy pain

Version **1.5.0+** adds color-coding based on the World of Warcraft rarity scheme - from *poor* (grey, sad, mildly apologetic) to *legendary* (orange, smug, expensive).

The server-side portion of the mod exposes an endpoint that politely hands the client mod the relevant backend configuration and flea prices.

Everything is configured through the BepInEx Configurator.  
And yes, the mod is designed to whisper requests to the SPT server, not shout them.

#### Requirements

Practically none. If you can run SPT, you can run this.

#### If you use the FIKA headless client:

Splendid news: **Do not install anything there.** Seriously, don’t. It will only cause complications, headaches, and possibly the rising of ancient eldritch forces. Add this mod to your `Exclusions.json` if you use Corter’s Mod Sync.

#### Configuration

Access the BepInEx Configurator (usually via **F12** or **F1**) and behold:

![BepInEx Plugin Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swiftxp-hub/spt-show-me-the-money/refs/heads/main/Assets/plugin-configuration.png)

Here you can also summon fresh flea market prices from the server. This is particularly handy if you’re using **SPT-LiveFleaPrices**, which updates prices regularly but not telepathically.

Just to be clear: Triggering this does **not** cause LiveFleaPrices itself to contact the celestial flea-market-gods. It simply fetches whatever your SPT server already knows.

#### Remarks

- Changes to trader price markups (e.g., via SVM) are automatically accounted for.  
- Multiple languages are supported, but if something looks as if it was spat out by a malfunctioning Babel Fish, leave a comment. Disabling color-coding may help.

#### Known compatibility

- SPT-LiveFleaPrices ≥ v2.0.1 (DrakiaXYZ)  
- UIFixes ≥ v5.0.5 (Tyfon)  
- ODT’s Item Info ≥ v2.0.2 (kobethuy)  
  - Note: ODT’s Item Info has Opinions™ about how color-coding should work. It may overwrite item-name color, but price colors remain intact.  
- All Quests Checkmarks ≥ v1.3.1 (ZGFueDkx)  
- MoreCheckmarks ≥ v2.0.0 (VIPkiller17)  

#### Planned features/changes

- … *(imagine a gentle, wistful sigh here)*

#### Known problems

- A friend of mine occasionally experiences a stuck tooltip when using the flea-tax toggle. I have investigated this thoroughly and discovered that… I still have no idea why it happens.  
- Some weapons feature suffixes like “Carbine.” These sometimes refuse to participate in color-coding. Possibly out of spite.

#### Problems that may occur

- Traders added by other mods may or may not play nicely with the price system.  
- The flea-tax toggle exists to maintain peace between tooltip-altering mods. If something goes wrong, let me know.

### SPT 4.x Installation

### FAQ  
*(Last updated Dez 11, 2025 — SMTM v2.5.3)*

- **How do I install SMTM?**  
  - Extract the folders into your SPT directory. If that sounds too simple, consult the installation section(s).

- **How do I configure SMTM?**  
  - Press F12 or F1. A configuration window will appear, as if summoned from a parallel dimension.

- **Is there a quick-sell addon?**  
  - Yes! It has its own tab. It is quite proud of this.

- **No price information appears. What now?**  
  - Check your installation. Reinstall if confused. Also, please don’t use WinRAR to extract `.7z` files. It sometimes mangles them like a clumsy Vogon.

- **No flea market prices?**  
  - You must unlock the flea market unless you enable “Always show flea market price.” If prices are missing entirely, the server component is probably not installed correctly.

- **I get SSL errors. Help?**  
  - Unlikely to be SMTM’s fault. SSL in Tarkov behaves like a paranoid toaster. Seek help on the SPT Discord.

- **Why do flea prices differ from the average?**  
  - Because:
    - SMTM shows the 100% sell-chance price, not the average.  
    - It updates flea data every 5 minutes to avoid server overload.  
    - Live Flea Prices may cause sudden market lurches.  
    - The flea market is fundamentally chaotic, briefly capable of holding an opinion, and possibly drunk.

- **Displayed flea prices seem wildly wrong. Why?**  
  - Check your settings (SPT, SVM, SMTM, etc.). If still wrong, report details: item, expected vs shown price, screenshots, logs, the alignment of Jupiter, etc.

- **Armor plates don’t affect flea price. Why?**  
  - Because SPT 4.0.4 also ignores plate value in its sell-chance logic. SMTM 2.5.0 can display plate value separately. SPT 4.0.5 may fix this.

- **Key remaining-uses don’t affect the price. Why?**  
  - SPT 4.0.4 bug. A 1/40 key and a 40/40 key sell for the same amount. SMTM mimics SPT’s logic.
    **SPT 4.0.5 fixed this bug.** Update for SMTM (2.5.1) is available.

#### Support & Feature Requests

I maintain this in my spare time, between bouts of existential dread and tea.  
Please be patient.

#### Why this mod exists

My friends and I play SPT co-op via FIKA.  
We used another price-display mod that turned our poor little VServer into a molten puddle of lag.  
Requests flooded in like panicked bureaucrats. The server begged for mercy.

So I built a new plugin. This one. Designed to be gentle, efficient, and unlikely to ignite anything.

It worked splendidly, so I shared it.

**Shout-out to the SPT team and all modders.  
You’re brilliant, bewildering, and beloved.**
